# Project Setup Progress - May 22, 2024

## Overview
Initial setup of the PDF to Markdown converter project, establishing the basic repository structure and implementing core functionality.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Core Script Development
- Created two versions of the PDF to Markdown converter:
  - `pdf_to_markdown_1a.py`: Basic version with essential features
  - `improved_pdf_to_md_converter_1a.py`: Enhanced version with additional functionality

### 2. Feature Implementation
- Implemented automatic table of contents generation
- Added section detection with flexible heading patterns
- Created clean text extraction with header/footer removal
- Developed file naming convention with date and letter suffix
- Added file overwrite protection

### 3. Project Structure
- Set up basic project files:
  - `README.md`: Project documentation
  - `requirements.txt`: Dependencies (pypdf, pdfplumber)
  - `.gitignore`: Version control exclusions
- Established output directory structure:
  - `md_orig(1a)`: For basic version outputs
  - `md_imp(1a)`: For improved version outputs

### 4. Version Control
- Initialized Git repository
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/whyerweaver/pdf_to_md
- Implemented proper `.gitignore` to exclude:
  - Generated markdown files
  - PDF input files
  - Basic script versions
  - Python cache and environment files

## Testing
- Successfully tested both script versions with various PDF files
- Verified file naming convention with letter suffix increment
- Confirmed proper section detection and markdown formatting

## Next Steps
1. Add proper project structure with source and test directories
2. Implement additional documentation
3. Add license file
4. Consider adding unit tests
5. Plan for feature enhancements

## Notes
- Both script versions are functional and producing expected results
- File naming convention successfully implemented: `filename (letter_MMM_DD).md`
- Proper handling of file overwrites with letter suffix increment
