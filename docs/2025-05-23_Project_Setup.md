# Project Setup Progress - May 23, 2025

## Overview
Today's session focused on experimental upgrades to the PDF to Markdown converter, followed by a strategic fallback to the stable version after testing revealed significant over-detection issues.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Experimental Feature Development
- Implemented advanced section detection using font size and boldness heuristics.
- Added artifact removal for repeated instructor notes.
- Combined multiple heuristics (regex, whitespace, font, bold) for section header recognition.

### 2. Testing and Evaluation
- Ran the upgraded script on a real-world PDF ("Lesson 2 â€“ Build Dynamic Content Navigation").
- Identified over-detection: nearly every line was treated as a section header, resulting in unusable markdown output.
- Compared output to the original basic version and confirmed the need for stricter heuristics.

### 3. Version Management
- Archived the experimental script as `pdf_to_markdown_experimental.py` for future reference and debugging.
- Restored the original, stable `pdf_to_markdown.py` as the main working version.

### 4. Documentation and Planning
- Decided to document the session as a learning experience and to preserve both working and experimental code paths.
- Outlined next steps for future sessions: incremental, test-driven upgrades with careful tuning of section detection logic.

## Lessons Learned
- Aggressive heuristics can lead to over-detection and unusable output.
- Incremental, test-driven development is essential for robust document parsing.
- Preserving both stable and experimental versions allows for safe exploration and easy fallback.

## Next Steps
1. Plan and implement more selective section header detection (possibly requiring multiple criteria).
2. Continue artifact removal and output cleanup as needed.
3. Document all changes and maintain clear version history.
4. Consider user-configurable options for advanced features in the improved version.

## Notes
- The project now has a clear separation between stable and experimental code.
- All progress and lessons from today are documented for future reference.
